### TODO List
- [x] Convert SAO star catalog to txt format, by running `sh scripts/convert.sh`.
- [x] Simulate to generate star image, by running `sh scripts/simulate.sh`.
- [x] Generate database, by running `sh scripts/gen_database.sh`.
- [x] Search to identifify star (with no noise), by running `sh scripts/search.sh`.
- [ ] Add noise
